# Nascent Design Theory of Traffic Predictive Analytics Decisional Guidance
Nascent Design Theory of Traffic Predictive Analytics Decisional Guidance: To categorize and enable the generalization of the type of Information System proposed, we also articulate core prescriptions underpinning the Traffic Analytics Guidance Framework and Tool in the form of a nascent design theory.

Our study proposes a nascent design theory of traffic predictive analytics decisional guidance. The [PDF here](../blob/main/TAG_F_Design_Theory_Final.pdf) provides details about this design theory.
